  <h2>Wild Atlantic Way Dining tips</h2>
        <p>Dining along the Wild Atlantic Way is all about embracing local flavors and seasonal ingredients. Many restaurants and cafés focus on fresh seafood, grass-fed meats, and produce sourced from nearby farms, so take the opportunity to try regional specialties like mussels, chowder, or Irish lamb. Booking ahead is a good idea, especially in smaller towns where the most popular spots can fill up quickly during peak tourist season.</p>
        <p>For a more relaxed experience, explore local farmers’ markets or stop at roadside food trucks, where you’ll often find artisanal cheeses, fresh baked goods, and handmade treats. Pair your meals with local craft beers, ciders, or even Irish whiskey for a true taste of the region. And don’t be afraid to ask locals for recommendations—some of the best dining experiences are hidden gems you might not find in guidebooks.</p>
